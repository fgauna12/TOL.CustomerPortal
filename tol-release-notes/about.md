Tree of Life Birth and Gynecology offers home birth and birth center deliveries. Our dedication and commitment to natural childbirth and parenting is what motivated us to pursue opening this center.  We consider ourselves the protectors or lifeguard during birth and strongly support choice for the family throughout the process. 

We provide complete obstetric and gynecological services in the office. We strongly feel women receive a higher quality of care due to the personalized appointments, relaxed atmosphere, and emphasis on client education and participation. You are not sick . . . Youâ€™re pregnant!
